# Shape Propagator
By Sasha Morgan
ECE 2574

## Project Description

A program called propagate that computes the shape of a propagating interface moving with a spatially dependent speed. Such interfaces are common in many applications of computational geometry, fluid mechanics, computer vision, and material science. For example, simulations of natural phenomena like fires and floods can be considered as a moving interface.
